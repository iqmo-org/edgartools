On August 19, 2011, The Korean Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office filed a criminal indictment against DSK for vicarious criminal liability for negligence in supervising the acts of one of the four individuals, which was a DSK employee. DSK is a broker dealer in Korea that is a subsidiary of DBAG and an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. The subject KOSPI Matter involves the allegation that the DB's equity traders based in Hong Kong and in DSK manipulated the closing KOSPI200 Index on Nov 10, 2010, when they sold a large basket of stocks worth approx. USD 1.6 Billion, when unwinding an index arbitrage position. During the closing auction on that day the KOSPI200 fell by approx. 2.7%. The equity traders had various other positions that resulted in a profit arising from the fall in the index. The FSS and the Korean prosecutors investigated the matter in 2011. A criminal indictment was filed against three ex-employees of DB Hong Kong and one employee of DSK an against DSK for vicarious criminal liability for the acts of its employee. The criminal trial commenced in Jan 2012 with a decision at the first trial level rendered on January 25, 2016. Appeals have been filed and are pending. While Korea is a jurisdiction that does not differentiate between a felony and misdemeanor, the eventual punishment rendered against DSK in Jan 2016, a fine over $1,000, not makes it clear that this event falls under the definition of a felony as provided in the Form BD definitions. DSK was convicted on 1/25/2016. DSK was subject to a criminal fine of KRW 1.5 Billion (Approx. 1.25M) and forfeiture of illegal profits. The prosecutor has filed an appeal and DSK has filed a counter-appeal. There is no final due date set for the criminal fine due to the pending appeals. DB and DSK have already disgorged the profits on the trading activities to the prosecutors.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(a)(1)(vi). </b></font>

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, DBSI consented to the entry of an injunction permanently enjoining it from engaging in violations of Section 15(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC has granted waivers, exemptions, and no-action relief from the collateral consequences of the injunction in areas under the SEC's jurisdiction. In addition to the injunction noted above, the judgment of the District Court requires DBSI to comply with the undertakings specified in the judgment, and provides that DBSI may be required to pay civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21(D)(3) of the Exchange Act. The undertakings require, among other things, that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; agree not to liquidate its own inventory of a particular ARS without making that liquidity opportunity available, as soon as practicable, for eligible customers; and provide other relief as described in the judgment.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(b)(1)(vi). </b></font>

On December 21, 2006 the SEC instituted and settled an administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("DBSI") in connection with DBSI's alleged failure to properly supervise one of its former registered representatives who had engaged in deceptive market timing of mutual fund shares in client accounts. The SEC further alleged that DBSI, through the conduct of the former registered representative, violated Rule 22C-1(A), as adopted under section 22(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by the conduct of the former registered representative entering late trades for at least one customer. The SEC alleged that the former registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares for the 4:00 P.M. eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated Section 15(B)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act because it allegedly failed to properly supervise the former registered representative who had engaged in the conduct. On December 21, 2006 the SEC also issued an order under Rule 602(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., Deutsche Investment Management Americas, Inc., and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., granting a waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(C)(3). Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations or findings, DBSI agreed to total payment of $442,954, consisting of $202,835 in disgorgement, $202,835 in civil penalty, and $37,284 in prejudgment interest.

The SEC also issued a cease and desist order against DIMA and DAMI.

("KDI"); Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc., formerly, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ("Scudder Kemper"): and Scudder Investor Services, Inc. are wholly owned, indirect and/or direct subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Americas Holding Corp. On December 22, 1999, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. ("Scudder Kemper"), and Gary P. Johnson, the former head of the derivatives trading desk in Scudder Kemper's Boston office, consented to the filing of an administrative order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Order"), without admitting or denying the findings contained in the Order. See In the Matter of Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. and Gary Paul Johnson, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 1848; Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 24218. The SEC alleged in the Order that the activities giving rise to the administrative proceeding arose from the actions of a former trader at Scudder Kemper's Boston derivatives trading desk, who violated applicable trading limits established by portfolio managers in certain institutional accounts, including registered investment companies, managed by Scudder Kemper during a period from July 1997 through October 9, 1998. The Order states that the trader concealed his activities by miscoding order tickets, forging portfolio manager signatures on order tickets and in many instances, by not submitting order tickets at all. On the date of the Order, the SEC also instituted administrative proceedings against Michael T. Sullivan, the former trader. Michael Sullivan, in settling the proceedings, was barred from association with any investment adviser and investment company for five years, with the right to reapply thereafter. Upon discovering the trader's misconduct, Scudder Kemper halted the trading program and cooperated fully with the SEC in its investigation of the misconduct. Scudder Kemper has reimbursed the losses in all affected accounts. Prior to the date of the Order, Scudder Kemper adopted enhanced supervisory controls and procedures to address the issues giving rise to the Order. The Order notes that the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Scudder Kemper and Gary Johnson and the cooperation afforded the SEC staff. The Order alleges that as a result of the trader's misconduct, losses of more than $16 million were incurred. The SEC alleged that Mr. Johnson and Scudder Kemper failed to supervise the trader and, through the trader's actions, failed accurately to maintain certain required books and records under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Order suspended Mr. Johnson from association with the investment adviser for a period of three months, from acting in a supervisory capacity with any investment adviser for nine months and fined Mr. Johnson. The Order censured Scudder Kemper, ordered it to comply with certain provision of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, fined Scudder Kemper $250,000 and required Scudder Kemper to perform various undertakings.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(c)(2)(vi). </b></font>

On January 9, 2007, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") settled an administrative action with the SEC. The action alleged that between January 2003 and June 2004, DBTCA and two other firms each failed to conduct auctions for auction rate securities according to procedures set forth in issuers' and broker-dealers' disclosure documents. Specifically, all three firms allegedly accepted new or revised bids after the submission deadline and allowed broker-dealers to submit bids to prevent failed auctions. DBTCA and another firm also allegedly allowed bids to prevent all-hold auctions. The SEC alleged that by engaging in these practices, the firms caused violations of Section 17(A)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, DBTCA and the other firms consented to the entry of an order which (1) requires each firm to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and future violations of section 17(A)(2) of the Securities Act; (2) requires each firm to provide certain disclosures of its material and current auction practices and procedures; and (3) requires each firm, not later than six months after the date of order, to have its CEO or General Counsel certify that it has implemented procedures in accordance with the auction procedures disclosed in the disclosure documents and any supplemental disclosures related to auction rate securities area. In addition, the firms have undertaken to make payments which are based upon their relative market share and their conduct. DBTCA's payment will be $750,000.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(c)(2)(vi). </b></font>

On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a cease and desist order in a settled administrative proceeding against Deutsche Bank AG. The matter related to the manner in which DBAG valued "GAP Risk" associated with certain Leveraged Super Senior ("LLS") synthetic CDO positions during Q4 2008 and Q1 2009, which was the height of the financial crisis. GAP Risk is the risk of loss that can result if the present value of a trade falls below the value of collateral for the trade posted by the counterparty. During the two quarters at issue, DBAG did not adjust its value of the LSS Trades to account for Gap Risk, essentially assigning a zero value for Gap Risk. The SEC found that although there was no standard industry model to value Gap Risk, and the valuation of these instruments was complex, DBAG did not reasonably adjust the value of the LSS Trades for Gap Risk during these periods, resulting in misstatements of its financial statements for the two quarters at issue. The SEC also found that DBAG failed to maintain adequate systems and controls over the valuation process. The SEC found violations of Section 13(A) (Requirement to file accurate periodic reports with the SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (Requirement to maintain accurate books and records), and 13(B)(2)(B) (Requirement to maintain reasonable internal accounting controls). DBAG paid a $55MN penalty and neither admitted nor denied the findings. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG agreed to pay the fine of $55,000,000.00 which was paid on June 9, 2015. DBAG was ordered to pay a fine of $55,000,000.00. The fine was paid on June 9, 2015.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(c)(2)(vi). </b></font>

The SEC also alleged that DBSI violated the analysts certification requirement of Regulation AC because DBSI issued a research report prepared and certified by a senior equity research analyst that was inconsistent with the analyst's personally held views. Lastly, the SEC alleged the DBSI failed to preserve, maintain, and timely produce to the SEC staff certain electronic communications that had been conducted on an internal DBSI messaging system.

("DBSI"): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of Auction Rate Securities ("ARS"), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Pursuant to a consent order executed on June 3, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $1,057,350.69 to New Jersey and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. DBSI also agreed to pay $15,000 to the North American Securities Administrators Association ("NASAA") as reimbursement for costs associated with NASAA'S assistance on NJ's investigation. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the "August 31 Term Sheet"). The August 31 Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $1,057,350.69 penalty imposed by New Jersey is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. RCW 21.20.110(1)(G) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. RCW 21.20.110(1)(J) allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to a consent order entered by the Division on December 1, 2009, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $154,308.35 to the Washington Division of Securities and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the "Term Sheet"). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $30,000 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(1)(vi). </b></font>

				Description of the Action
			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 1/13/2010. The Department alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("DBSI"): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ("ARS"), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the consent order, DBSI consented to the Department making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Ark. Code Ann. section 23-42-308(A)(2)(G) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Ark. Code Ann. section 23-42-308(A)(2)(J) allows the Department, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Department on January 13, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $35,781.78 ($3,578.17 to the Arkansas State Fund at the Investor Protection Trust and $32,203.61 to the Department) and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the "Term Sheet"). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $35,781.78 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(1)(vi). </b></font>

Section 115.10(B)(1) of the Board rules allows the Board, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 115.10(B)(1) of the Board rules allows the Board, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the consent order entered by the Board on April 8, 2010, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $827,886.15 to the Texas State Securities Board and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the "Term Sheet"). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $827,886.15 penalty imposed by the Board is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(1)(vi). </b></font>

The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $343,481.09 penalty imposed by the Department is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(1)(vi). </b></font>

				Description of the Action
			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date: 9/21/2011. The Division alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("DBSI"): (1) engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities ("ARS"), and (2) failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the administrative consent order, DBSI consented to the Division making the following conclusions of law: (1) in connection with (I) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (II) the failure to adequately disclose to clients the effect of DBSI's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS issues, and (III) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the securities business. Section 10-5-4 (A)(8) of the Georgia Securities Act of 1973 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has engaged in unethical or dishonest practices in the securities business; and (2) in connection with the failure to (I) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (II) create and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, (III) ensure accurate disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, and (IV) ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise, and establish and enforce procedures necessary to detect and prevent such conduct. Section 10-5-4(A)(11) of the Georgia Securities Act of 1973 allows the Division, through its administrator, to take action against DBSI if it has failed to reasonably supervise its representatives or employees. Pursuant to the administrative consent order entered by the Division on September 21, 2011, DBSI agreed to pay a penalty of $146,719.76 to the Georgia Office of the Secretary of State and to take certain measures with respect to current and former clients that purchased ARS before February 13, 2008. The administrative consent order finalized the terms of a settlement that had been reached in August 2008 between DBSI's parent and NASAA and that resulted in a term sheet (the "Term Sheet"). The Term Sheet required a total penalty of $15,000,000 to NASAA member jurisdictions, and the $146,719.76 penalty imposed by the Division is its pro-rata share of the total penalty amount. The consent order requires that DBSI offer to purchase at par certain ARS from eligible investors; reimburse eligible investors that sold ARS below par; participate in a special arbitration procedure for consequential damages claims by eligible investors; work to provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors not part of the ARS buy back; and provide other relief as described in the consent order.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(1)(vi). </b></font>

				Description of the Action
			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 1/30/2017. On January 30, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") entered into a final notice under Principle 3 (Management and Control) and Senior Management Arrangements. Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 (the relevant period). Specifically, the FCA found that with respect to DBAG, the AML control framework was substantially inadequate, and the risks raised were highlighted by certain trading arranged by Deutsche Bank's Russia-based subsidiary (DB Moscow) and booked to Deutsche Bank's trading books in London. The FCA found that the way these trades were conducted in combination with their scale and volume were highly suggestive of financial crime. The FCA found that the suspicious securities trades, which it referred to as "Mirror Trades" were used by customers of Deutsche Bank and DB Moscow that were connected to each other to transfer more than USD 6 billion from Russia, through Deutsche Bank in the UK, to overseas bank accounts. The orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which executed both sides as the same time. The FCA found that DBAG breached Principle 3 and SYSC Rules6.1.1 R and 6.3.1 R in that, during the relevant period, in its Corporate Banking and Securities decision business, (1) its Customer Due Diligence ("CDD") and Enhanced Due Diligence ("EDD") was inadequate in that it failed to obtain sufficient information about its customers in inform the risk assessment process and to provide a basis for transaction monitoring; (2) its culture failed to instill a sense of responsibility in the front office business for the identification and management of non-financial risks, particularly in the London front office, which failed to appreciate that it was ultimately responsible for Deutsche Bank's KYC obligations; (3) it used flawed AML customer and country risk rating methodologies which meant that customers were assigned inappropriate risk ratings; (4) its AML policies and procedures were deficient; (5) its AML IT infrastructure was inadequate and failed to provide a single authoritative repository of KYC information; (6) it lacked automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades and lacked an effective system for monitoring money flows associated with transaction; and (7) it failed to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by the Moscow front office as well as other Non-UK transactions. DBAG consented to the entry of the final notice on January 30, 2017 by the FCA, pursuant in which DBAG shall pay a civil monetary penalty of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which DBAG paid on February 1, 2017. The Order required DB to pay a financial penalty in the amount of 163,076,224 (pound sterling), which the bank paid on February 1, 2017.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(2)(vi). </b></font>

			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 1/30/2017. On January 30, 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services ("DFS"), DBAG and DBAG's New York Branch entered into a consent Order under New York Banking Law Sections 33,44 and 44-A. Specifically, the DFS found that DBAG suffered from serious compliance deficiencies that allowed certain bank traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out of Russia, by using the services of Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York to convert rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernable economic purpose. The DFS found that DBAG and DBAG's New York branch conducted their banking business in an unsafe and unsound manner, in violation of New York Banking Law Sections 44, 44-A, failed to maintain an effective money laundering program, in violation of 3 N.Y.C.R. R. Section 116.2, and failed to maintain and make available true and accurate books, accounts and records reflecting all transactions and actions, in violation of New York Banking Law Section 200-C. DBAG and DBAG's New York branch consented to the entry of the Order on January 30, 2017 by DFS, pursuant to which DBAG and DBAG's New York branch: (a) shall pay a civil monetary penalty of $425 million, which DBAG paid on February 3, 2017; and (b) engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA")/ Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York branch recommend corrective actions, and oversee the implementation of corrective actions the DFS deems necessary. The Order requires DBAG to engage an independent monitor within 60 days of the Order to conduct a comprehensive review of existing BSA/AML compliance programs, policies and procedures in place at the bank that pertain to or affect activities conducted by or through (a) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and (b) DBAG's New York branch. The independent monitor must submit to DBAG a written report on its findings and recommendations. Sixty days thereafter, DBAG must submit to the DFS a written action plan to improve and enhance its BSA/AML compliance programs, after which the DFS will determine which recommendations DBAG should implement. The independent monitor will thereafter oversee the implementation of the recommendations, assess DBAG's compliance with the corrective measures, and submit additional reports or recommendations as necessary. The Order required DBAG to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $425 million, which the Firm paid on February 3, 2017.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(2)(vi). </b></font>

			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Initiation date 4/22/2009. LSE alleged that Deutsche Bank AG quoted prices on an ETF that were half the value of that last traded. As a result the ETF was suspended and the closing auction delayed. DB London accepted the fine and has proactively developed and implemented a new quoting system with more sophisticated logic to prevent similar violations. The fine imposed was 25,000 GBP.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(2)(vi). </b></font>

On May 30, 2017, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG's New York Branch, DB USA Corporation, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas entered into an Order pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(B) and 12 U.S. C. Section 1818 (I). Specifically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board found that (A) the most recent examination of the BSA/AML program at DBTCA and the New York branch conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified significant deficiencies in DBTCA's and the branch's risk management and compliance with BSA/AML requirements that resulted in a violation of the Regulatory Compliance Program requirement, and (B) deficiencies in DBTCA's transaction monitoring capabilities prevented DBTCA from properly assessing BSA/AML risk for billions of dollars in certain potentially suspicious transactions. Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG's New York Branch, DB USA Corporation, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas consented to the entry of the Order signed on May 26, 2017 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to which Deutsche Bank (A) committed to pay a civil money penalty of $41 million, which Deutsche Bank paid on June 6, 2017; and (B) committed to affirmative obligations including the retention of independent third parties to review DBTCA's compliance with applicable BSA/AML requirements and to conduct a transaction review of DBTCA's foreign correspondent banking activity from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016; and the submission of several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, and monitoring. These obligations have various due dates beginning 30 days after the Order was signed. The Order imposes affirmative obligations including the retention of independent third parties to review DBTCA's compliance with applicable BSA/AML requirements and to conduct a transaction review of DBTCA's foreign correspondent banking activity from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The Order also requires certain Deutsche Bank entities to submit several distinct written remediation plans and programs targeted at strengthening the bank's compliance, risk management, monitoring, and reporting functions. The Order required DBAG to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $41 million, which the Firm paid on June 6, 2017.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(d)(4)(vi). </b></font>

FINRA alleged that during the period from January 1, 2008 through June 15, 2012, in 98 instances, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.'s ("DBSI" or "firm") trade volume manually advertised by traders on Autex, Bloomberg and/or Reuters substantially exceeded the Firm's executed trade volume for the security involved. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule S 2110, 2210, 3310 and IM-3310. In addition, FINRA alleged that, during the period October 15, 2010 through June 15, 2012, the Firm's systems failed to accurately advertise trade volume. FINRA alleged that more than four billion shares, which comprised about four percent of the Firm's volume during the period, that were not eligible for advertisement were advertised. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated FINRA Rules 2010 and 5210 and NASD Rule 2210. Finally, FINRA alleged that the Firm failed to establish and implement a supervisory system that was reasonably designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for accuracy in the Firm's advertisements of executed trade volume. FINRA alleged that this conduct violated NASD Rule 2010 (for the period prior to December 15, 2008), FINRA Rule 2010 (for the period on and after December 15, 2008) and NASD Rule 3010. In determining the sanctions in this matter, FINRA took into account that, upon receiving the FINRA staff's initial inquiry letter for this matter, the Firm (i) conducted an internal investigation, (ii) provided a written summation of the results of that investigation, and (iii) imposed disciplinary actions against some of the traders responsible for certain of the inflated advertisements. In addition, the Firm self-reported the remainder of the violations to the FINRA staff prior to FINRA becoming aware of the issues involved. Without admitting or denying FINRA's findings and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, DBSI consented, solely for the purpose of this proceeding, to the entry of FINRA's findings with respect to allegations of violations of NASD and FINRA Rules (listed under allegations) as a result of overstating its advertised trade volume and failing to establish and implement appropriate supervisory procedures regarding advertised trade volume. DBSI also consented to the following sanctions: a censure and fine in the amount of $1.25 million; and an undertaking to revise the Firm's supervisory procedures relating to advertised trade volume. The fine was paid on 1/2/13.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(e)(1)(vi). </b></font>

FINRA also alleged deficiencies in DBSI's Form ATS filing.

The NYSE alleged that DBSI violated the above cited Rules by the conduct of a DBSI former registered representative who entered late trades for at least one customer. More specifically, the NYSE alleged that the registered representative received and entered orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares after 4:00 P.M. Eastern time market close on certain occasions where customer orders received before 4:00 P.M. were blocked by fund companies as market timing trades. The customer orders entered into after 4:00 P.M. served as substitute orders for those that had been previously received and blocked before 4:00 P.M. The NYSE further alleged that DBSI violated NYSE Rule 342 by failing to reasonably supervise the registered representative and failing to establish and maintain appropriate procedures for supervision and control effective to detect and prevent the registered representative's deceptive customer trading of mutual funds. DBSI, without admitting or denying the allegations or findings, consented to censure and total payment of $442,954. In view of the above findings the NYSE imposed the penalty consented to by DBSI of a censure and a total payment in the amount of $442,954.

It was also alleged that failure to do so further caused DBSI to experience certain systemic deficiencies relating to the delivery of offering documents to certain customers who purchased securities and that DBSI failed to provide for adequate supervisory controls and review procedures. DBSI, without admitting or denying guilt, consented to a finding by an NYSE hearing officer that it violated NYSE Rule 401(A) by failing to adhere to the principles of good business practice by failing to ensure the delivery of prospectuses in connection with certain sales of registered securities in violation of Section 5(B)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, DBSI consented to a finding that it had violated NYSE Rule 1100(B) by failing to deliver product descriptions to certain customers who purchased certain exchange traded funds and consented to a finding that DBSI had violated NYSE Rule 342 by failing to provide for, establish and maintain appropriate procedures of supervision and control, including a system of follow up and review, with respect to its operational and technological activities relating to the delivery of product descriptions and prospectuses. The hearing officer noted that DBSI cooperated fully in responding to enforcement's investigation and had already developed and implemented new written supervisory and operational policies and procedures relating to the delivery of prospectuses and product descriptions. DBSI, without admitting or denying guilt, consented to a finding by an NYSE hearing officer that it violated NYSE Rule 401(A) by failing to adhere to the principles of good business practice; accepted a fine of $1,250,000.00 and censure.

In DBSI's case, FINRA alleged that the advertised aggregate trade volume for two equity securities exceeded the firm's executed trade volume for those securities. FINRA further alleged that the firm's supervisory system was not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with respect to the advertising rules. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent, consenting to a $150,000.00 fine and censure. DBSI consented to a censure and a fine of $150,000.00. The fine was paid on January 9, 2008. DBSI was also required to revise its written supervisory procedures with respect to compliance with NASD Rule 3310 within 30 days of acceptance of the AWC.

Specifically, NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. alleged the firm effected an unquantified but significant number of short sales on at least the five desks in securities that were not on the firm easy-to-borrow list without having borrowed the securities or entered into bona-fide arrangements to borrow the securities, or having reasonable grounds to believe that the securities could be borrowed for delivery when due, and without the proper documentation of such. Further, NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. alleged at least two of such desks did not properly adhere to the independent trading unit aggregation requirements and one trader on each of the two desks did not correctly mark an unquantified but significant number of proprietary sell orders. As a result, certain short sales allegedly were incorrectly marked long, and some of those orders allegedly were improperly executed. NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. also alleged the firm failed to adequately supervise certain traders on at least the five desks and failed to maintain and enforce written supervisory procedures concerning proprietary short sales in a manner reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the relevant provisions of Reg SHO and NYSE Arca Equities rules.

				Description of the Action
			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 8/10/2012. This matter stems from the personal financial difficulties of a former DBSI client advisor in the firm's Boston branch. Between approximately January 2009 and April 2010, the client advisor misused a corporate credit card for personal charges, bounced checks, and borrowed money from one of his customers. DBSI terminated his employment in April 2010. In the AWC settling this matter, DBSI accepted and consented, without admitting or denying, that the firm's lexicon-based search system for the review of electronic correspondence in the PCS division was inadequate to search for terms indicating that a client advisor might be experiencing personal financial difficulties and/or violating certain applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with those difficulties, and that the firm's supervisory system and written supervisory procedures were inadequate to effectively respond to such "red flags." Accordingly, as set forth more fully in the AWC, the firm has undertaken to add terms to its email review lexicon for client advisors, to review electronic communications of client advisors from January 1, 2012 to date using those additional terms, and to review its supervisory procedures for responding to "red flags" of potential misconduct by a client advisor relating to such personal financial difficulties. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBSI agreed to a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent ("AWC") consenting to a censure and fine of $100,000.00.

				Description of the Action
			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 12/11/2014. FINRA alleged that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("DBSI") violated NASD Rule 2711(C)(4), 2711(E) and FINRA Rule 2010 in that DBSI in an effort to win investment banking business from a company, the Firm's equity research analyst participated in the Firm's solicitation efforts and the Firm offered favorable research coverage to the company to induce the company to award the Firm its investment banking business. The findings stated that following the analyst's presentation, the company asked the Firm to complete a template showing an "equity commitment committee approved" valuation of the company, which would include the analyst's views on the company's valuation. The company and its private equity owners (sponsors) asked the Firm to complete the template and provide a firm-wide valuation of the Firm, including the analyst, would be expected to support after the company awarded its Initial Public Offering (IPO) business, absent unexpected developments. Under the circumstances of the company's potential IPO the Firm offered favorable research coverage to induce receipt of investment banking business by completing and submitting to the company, during the solicitation period, the valuation template requested by the company and the sponsors. The Firm complied with the company's request. By providing the company the unified valuation it sought, the Firm indicated to the company that post-IPO research coverage would be positive and aligned with investment banking. The company and the sponsors selected the Firm as an underwriter and co-bookrunner for the company's IPO. The company, however, eventually decided not to proceed with the offering. Without admitting or denying allegations, DBSI agreed to a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent ("AWC") consenting to a censure and a fine of $4,000,000.00. DBSI consented to a censure and fine of $4,000,000.00. The fine was paid on December 18, 2014.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(e)(2)(vi). </b></font>

During the same sampled period, DBSI misreported options positions to the LOPR in tens of millions of instances as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., City, Quantity, and Tax Identification fields) when reporting those positions and its failure to report acting in concert identifiers in certain instances. This conduct violated ISE Rule 415(A). Also, DBSI failed to maintain adequate supervisory systems and controls, including adequate written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to achieve the accurate reporting of reportable options positions to the LOPR. This constitutes a violation of ISE Rule 401.

				Description of the Action
			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: Date Initiated: 3/28/2016. FINRA alleged DBSI exceeded the relevant position limit in three different securities for five different customers (exceeding the relevant position limit in a range of between 7.9 percent and 120 percent) for between one and seven consecutive days during October 2011, January 2014, and November 2014, and January 2015 through February 2015. The findings stated that the Firm reported incorrect options contract equivalent of the Net Delta (OCENDS), excluded certain expiring options from its end-of-day OCEND calculations in one symbol, and failed to report or failed to accurately report, an unknown but significant number of conventional options positions to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Large Options Positions Report (LOPR). In as many as approximately two million instances, the Firm had failed to report conventional options positions to the LOPR due to the Firm's failure to aggregate certain positions for Acting In Concert (AIC) purposes and the Firm's erroneous deletion of positions that fell below the 200-contract reporting threshold without first reporting the below-the-threshold amount to the OCC. In as many as 1.5 million instances, the Firm had over-reported conventional options to the LOPR due to the Firm's erroneous aggregation method and in tens of millions of instances, the Firm had failed to accurately report conventional options positions to the LOPR as a result of errors in various required LOPR data fields (e.g., Account Name, Tax Identification, and Account Address) and its failure to report AIC identifiers in certain instances. The findings also included that the Firm failed to maintain an adequate system of supervision, including systems of follow-up and review, which were reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rules governing the reporting of positions to the LOPR system and compliance with position limits. The Firm also lacked sufficient written supervisory procedures requiring reviews to ensure compliance with position limits, to determine that LOPR submissions were accurate, to review rejects, to ensure that all reportable positions had actually been reported, and to identify and report options positions appropriately as AIC. This constitutes violations of FINRA Rule 2360(B)(3), NASD Rule 2360(B)(3) (A)(VII) (B)(2)(A) (for the period prior to February 17, 2009) and FINRA Rules 2360 (B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(2)(A) (for the period of February 16, 2009), 2360(B)(3) (A)(II) (B)(4), Rule 2360 (B)(5), NASD Rule 3010 (for the period prior to 12/1/2014), and FINRA Rules 2010 and 3110 (for the period after 11/30/2014).

Specifically, the findings stated that on December 3, 2013, the Firm sent a clearly erroneous filing to NASDAQ in PTC, Inc. When it entered an order at 9:30:00, which resulted in a 100-share execution at $2.21 when the previous close on that stock was $32.58 and the NASDAQ official opening print at that time, but after the Firm's trade, was $32.43. The findings state further that on December 23, 2014, trades occurred between 9:33:00 and 9:34:00, in which the Firm received an electronic buy order for 50,000 shares at market price, and the Firm's Smart Order Router sent high-priced limit orders to various exchanges. Finally, the findings stated that on December 3, 2014, the Firm sent a CE Filing to NASDAQ in market vectors gold miners ETF when trades occurred between 15:59:00 and 16:00:00 in which a 250,000-share sell market order fully executed at $17.72, but NASDAQ declined to act, advising that the CE Filing did not meet the parameters to justify breaking the trade.

			</td><td><div class="fakeBox3">The Registrant has not been the subject of this matter: The Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") determined that Deutsche Securities Australia Limited ("DSAL") contravened ASX Market Rule 20.8.3 as a result of executing five special crossings in derivative market contracts over a cash market product for which there was a current offer period for a takeover bid and contravened ASX Market Rule 20.8.4 by executing one special crossing in a combination when a component part of the combination was a derivatives market contract over a cash market product for which there was a current offer period for a takeover bid. The ASX Rules prohibit special size crossings being executed in securities that are party to a takeover situation. The ASX contacted ("DSAL") on May 1, 2006 regarding six separate special crossings in the stock of Patrick Corporation that had been executed at a time when Patrick was a subject of a takeover bid. The special crossings occurred during a period beginning in December 2005 through mid March 2006. DSAL responded that the incorrect execution of special crossings was a result of genuine confusion regarding the status of the takeover bid. ASX Enforcement Division referred the matter to ASX Disciplinary Tribunal for consideration. The Tribunal imposed a monetary sanction of A$50,000 which was appealed by both DSAL and ASX Enforcement as being overly severe. In light of DSAL's co-operation with the initial investigation, its prior unblemished history and the action that DSAL had taken since the contraventions occurred, the Tribunal reduced the sanction to A$45,000 on January 24, 2007. On March 7, 2007, the ASX Issued a disciplinary circular naming DSAL and providing details of the offense and penalty imposed.

DBL internally identified and self reported to the FSA issues relating to both transactions. DBL appointed external advisors to undertake a detailed investigation into the transactions, the results of which were provided to the FSA in May 2004. The first transaction involved a book build in Scania AB, B shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 5, in that DBL had purchased high volumes of Scania AB, B shares using external brokers, rather than trading in DBL's own name, thereby increasing and stabilizing the share price. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL has also admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2, in that (1) DBL allowed the purchase of shares by an employee without pre-notification (2) DBL issued three coverage statements that were incomplete or inaccurate with respect to the actual degree of coverage, and (3) DBL issued an internal statement on the day following the transaction that DBL would be reporting to the Stockholm Stock Exchange that it currently held a 9.6% stake in Scania AB; this information was not properly embargoed, as a number of DBL employees disclosed it to clients, prior to the information being made public. The second transaction involved the stabilization of Cytos Biotechnology AG shares. For the purposes of the settlement with FSA, DBL has admitted breaches of FSA Principle 2 because (1) DBL failed to ensure that the stabilization trader followed DBL's internal procedures on stabilization; and (2) DBL failed to ensure that the London staff escalated trading issues to Compliance in a timely manner. The current status is closed on 4/11/2006. For the purposes of the settlement, DBL agreed to a total financial penalty of GBP 6,363,643 for breaches of FSA Principle 5 in respect to one of the transactions, and FSA Principle 2 in respect of both transactions. This fine was paid to the FSA on 13 April 2006. DBL agreed to pay: (i) a fine of GBP 3,500,000, and a "loss avoidance" figure of GBP 2,363,643 with respect to the Scania transaction due to the DBL purchases and the inaccurate coverage statements (ii) a fine of GBP 500,000 with respect to the Cytos Biotechnology transaction for failure to follow internal procedures on stabilization, and failure to escalate issue to Compliance in a timely manner.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="label"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>10(f)(vi). </b></font>

The AMF alleged that DBAG London, which handled a 1 billion Euro convertible bond issue for Vivendi in November 2002, did not fully respect the rules of good conduct which apply to market testing in passing on information about the issue to four hedge funds prior to the information becoming publicly known. The AMF found that the funds used this information to trade Vivendi shares. Without admitting or denying the allegations, DBAG London was sanctioned for technical and procedural reasons and there were no findings that DBAG London violated insider trading rules. Likewise, DBAG London was not sanctioned for passing information to the hedge funds. The AMF alleged that there were also material inaccuracies in the prospectus. However, this was viewed by the AMF as a formal breach, which on its own, would not warrant a high penalty.

The AMF concluded that DB had no culpability in relation to alleged insider dealing activities, but alleged procedural, record keeping omissions by DB, in relation to the records it maintained of the market soundings. On December 22, 2006, the AMF notified DB London that it would be sanctioned for technical and procedural violations in connection with a convertible bond offering by Alcatel, DB lead managed the transaction. There was no case to answer for insider trading. DB London conducted market soundings with several hedge funds ahead of the offering in December 2002. DB London was able to produce documentation sufficient to attest that it was engaged in market sounding which is permitted under AMF Rules. However, since the times the telephone contacts with the hedge funds were made were not evidenced in the documentation and the names of certain third parties were missing from the firm's records, AMF found that DB London acted contrary to French Market soundings regulations.

Following the decline of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 ("KOSPI 200") in the closing auction on November 11, 2010, by approximately 2.7%, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service ("FSS") commenced an investigation and expressed concerns that the fall in the KOSPI 200 was attributable to a sale by Deutsche Bank AG ("Deutsche Bank") of a basket of stocks, worth approximately "EUR 1.6 Billion", that was held as part of an index arbitrage position on the KOSPI 200. On February 23, 2011, the Korean Financial Services Commission, which oversees the work of the FSS, reviewed the FSS' findings and recommendations and resolved to take the following action: (I) to file a criminal complaint to the Korean Prosecutor's Office for alleged market manipulation against five employees of the Deutsche Bank Group and Deutsche Bank's subsidiary Deutsche Securities Korea Co. ("DSK") for vicarious liability; and (II) to impose a suspension of six months, commencing April 1, 2011, of DSK's business for proprietary trading of cash equities and listed derivatives and DMA (Direct Market Access) cash equities trading, and the requirement that DSK suspends the employment of one named employee for six months. There is an exemption to the business suspension to permit DSK to continue acting as liquidity provider for existing derivatives linked securities. The Korean Prosecutor's Office will now undertake its own investigation to determine whether to indict DSK and/or the relevant employees.
